There are 4 main files in this folder: 

- full.html: This is the big dog -- the other 3 html files are all create based on this one. This is the one I keep up to date with EVERYTHING, and then I create the other files from this file.
- index.html: This is my website. This is the one I post on the internet.
- cv.html: This is my CV. I create my CV from my website. To do this: delete the header, footer, shrink image, add info underneath "PhD Student in Computer Science at Texas A&M University" with phone number, email, etc. Remove buttons and images for each of the publications. Then print and save as PDF.
- resume.html: Same thing as above, but shorter.
